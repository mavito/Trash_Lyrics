I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes
No fair 
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes 
I'm scared 
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da 
 Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da 
Mmm 
Mmm 
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
