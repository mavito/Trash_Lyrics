I was walking down the street the other day
Tryna distract myself
But then I see your face
Oh wait thats someone else
Tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
Theres nothing subtle here
In my room theres a king size space
Bigger than it used to be
If you want you can rent that place
Call me an amenity
Even if its in my dreams
Ooh youre taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine

Guess Im a bad liar
I see how your attention builds
Its like looking in a mirror
Your touch like a happy pill
But still all we do is fear
What could possibly happen next
Can we focus on the love
Paint my kiss across your chest
If youre the art Ill be the brush
Ooh youre taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine
Oh Im tryin Im tryin Im tryin

I put you first and you adored it
Set fires to my forest
And you let it burn
Sang offkey in my chorus
Cause it wasnt yours
I saw the signs and I ignored it
Rosecolored glasses all distorted
Set fire to my purpose
And I let it burn
You got off on the hurtin
When it wasnt yours yeah
Wed always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me
This dancing was killing me softly
I needed to hate you to love me yeah
To love love yeah

In the thick of healing yeah

And now its goodbye its goodbye for usWhat the heart wants
What the heart wants
What the heart wants 
You got me sipping on something
I cant compare to nothing Ive ever known
Im hoping that after this fever Ill survive
I know Im acting a bit crazy
Strung out a little bit hazy
Hand over heart Im praying
That Im gonna make it out alive
The beds getting cold and youre not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But Im not alive until you call
And Ill bet the odds against it all
Save your advice cause I wont hear
You might be right but I dont care
Theres a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every seconds like torture
Heroin drip no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby baby no I cant escape
The beds getting cold and youre not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But Im not alive until you call
And Ill bet the odds against it all
Save your advice cause I wont hear
You might be right but I dont care
Theres a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings no wind in our sails
But I cant imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down down down down
The beds getting cold and youre not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But Im not alive until you call
And Ill bet the odds against it all
Save your advice cause I wont hear
You might be right but I dont care
Theres a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants baby
The heart wants what it wants baby
It wants what it wants
It wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants baby
The heart wants what it wants babyIn your eyes theres a heavy blue
One to love and one to lose
Sweet divine a heavy truth
Water or wine dont make me choose
I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night night
Drunk on a feeling alone with the stars in the sky
Ive been running through the jungle
Ive been running with the wolves
To get to you to get to you
Ive been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you to get to you
Ive looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you yeah all for you
Ive been running through the jungle
Ive been crying with the wolves
To get to you to get to you to get to you
To get to you
To get to you
Your fingertips trace my skin
To places I have never been
Blindly I am following
Break down these walls and come on in
I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night night
Drunk on a feeling alone with the stars in the sky
Ive been running through the jungle
Ive been running with the wolves
To get to you to get to you
Ive been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you to get to you
Ive looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you yeah all for you
Ive been running through the jungle
Ive been crying with the wolves
To get to you to get to you to get to you
To get to you
To get to you
Ive been running through the jungle
Ive been running with the wolves
To get to you to get to you
Ive been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you to get to you
Ive looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you yeah all for you
Ive been running through the jungle
Ive been crying with the wolves
To get to you to get to you to get to you
