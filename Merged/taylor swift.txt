Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if hes a ghost then I can be a phantom
Holdin him for ransom some
Some boys are tryin too hard he dont try at all though
Younger than my exes but he act like such a man so
I see nothing better I keep him forever
Like a vendettata

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin sorry
But if Im a thief then he can join the heist and
Well move to an island and

And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws paranoia and insecurities
Ive made mistakes and made some choices thats hard to deny
