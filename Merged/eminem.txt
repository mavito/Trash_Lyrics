All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian Lamar oh

Far as hard drugs are though thats the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow

Get your vinylsUgh youre a monster
I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and Ill feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squads in here walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and BBobby The
Brain Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shadys in this bitch Im possed up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin on me the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier 
In AA with an AK melee finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate retreat like a vacay mayday 
This beat is craycray Ray J HAHAHA
Laughing all the way to the bank I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the
Monster
You get in my way Ima feed you to the monster 
Im normal during the day but at night turn to a monster 
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla fire spitter monster
Blood on the dance floor and Louis V carpet
Fire Godzilla fire monster
Blood on the dance floor and Louis V carpet
Im just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx told em lick the balls
Had em just appalled did so many things that pissed em off
Its impossible to list em all
And in the midst of all this
Im in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see will I still be like this tomorrow
Risperdal voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on a guy with a missile launcher
Im just a Loch Ness the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle Im a
Monster
You get in my way Ima feed you to the monster 
Im normal during the day but at night turn to a monster 
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla fire spitter monster
Blood on the dance floor and Louis V carpet
Fire Godzilla fire monster
Blood on the dance floor and Louis V carpet
If you never gave a damn  raise your hand
Cause Im about to set trip vacation plans
Im on point like my index is so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin finger  prostate exam 
How can I have all these fans and perspire
Like a liars pants Im on fire
And I got no plans to retire and Im still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin out I only get more handsome and flyer
I got em passin out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
Cause I caught the flack but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink bitch I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk 
Bitch Im a player Im too motherfuckin stingy for Cher
Wont even lend you an ear aint even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch Ill marry her if shell bury her
Face in my genital area the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic and its scary call it Hari Kari
Cause ery Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin dictionary on em
Swearing up and down they can spit this shits hilarious
Its time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldnt see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column 
Trigger happy pack heat but its black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet what attracts these people
Is my Gangsta Bitch like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips you barely got a halfeaten Cheeto
Fill em with the venom and eliminate em
Other words I Minute Maid em
I dont wanna hurt em but I did Im in a fit of rage
Im murderin again nobody will evade
Im fittin to kill em and dumpin their fuckin bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything incinerate a renegade
Im here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But dont nobody want it but theyre gonna get it anyway
Cause Im beginnin to feel like Im mentally ill
Im Attila kill or be killed Im a killer bee the vanilla gorilla
Youre bringin the killer within me outta me
You dont wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
Or be on the receivin end of me what stupidity itd be
Every bit of mes the epitome of a spitter
When Im in the vicinity motherfucker you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
Im bout to fuckin finish you bitch Im unfadable
You wanna battle Im available Im blown up like an inflatable
Im undebatable Im unavoidable Im unevadable
Im on the toilet bowl I got a trailer full of money and Im paid in full

Next to Ja next to Benzino—die motherfucker
Like the last motherfucker sayin Hailie in vain
Alien brain you Satanist

The games mine again and aint nothin changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I mwah give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this 
Bein richshamed by some prick usin my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back aim
Yeah bitch pop Champagne to this 
Its your moment
This is it as big as youre gonna get so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep Ill give you a B for the effort
But if I was threefooteleven
Youd look up to me and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin shit is like Rambo when hes out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin machine gun when its outta ammo
Had enough of this tattedup mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle
Hell have to fuck Kim in my flannel
Ill give him my sandals
Cause he knows long as Im Shady hes gon have to live in my shadow
Exhausting letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel bitch get off me
You dance around it like a sombrero we can all see
Youre fuckin salty
Cause Young Geralds ballsdeep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater your black leather
You dress better I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter
Little white toothpick
Thinks its over a pic I just dont like you prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write Not Alike
But really I dont care whos in the right
But youre losin the fight you picked
Who else want it Kells—attempt fails Budden—Ls
Fuckin nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot I will not fail Im with the Doc still
But this idiots boss pops pills and tells him hes got skills
But Kells the day you put out a hits the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed ah
Im sick of you bein wack
And still usin that mothafuckin AutoTune
So lets talk about it 
Im sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it 
Im sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just cause you look in the mirror and think
That youre Marshall Mathers 
Dont mean you are and youre not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it
You fuckin—oh
And Im just playin Diddy
You know I love youLook if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip Yo
His palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
Theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti
Hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words wont come out
Hes choking how Everybodys joking now
The clocks run out times up over—blaow
Snap back to reality ope there goes gravity ope
There goes Rabbit he choked hes so mad but he wont
Give up that easy no he wont have it he knows
His whole backs to these ropes it dont matter hes dope
He knows that but hes broke hes so stagnant he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home thats when its
Back to the lab again yo this old rap shit he
Better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him and
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go 
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go 
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better…
His souls escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring but superstardoms
Close to postmortem it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter he blows its all over
These hoes is all on him coasttocoast shows
Hes known as the Globetrotter lonely roads
God only knows hes grown farther from home hes no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
These hoes dont want him no mo hes cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nosedove and sold nada and so the soap opera
Is told it unfolds I suppose its old partner
But the beat goes on dadadom dadom dahdah dahdah
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go 
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go 
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better…
No more games Ima change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin in the beginning the mood all changed
Ive been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebodys payin the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I cant get by with my nineto
Five and I cant provide the right type of life for my family
Cause man these goddamn food stamps dont buy diapers
And theres no movie theres no Mekhi Phifer this is my life
And these times are so hard and its gettin even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed plus teetertotter
Caught up between bein a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama screamin on her too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot another day of monotonys
Gotten me to the point Im like a snail Ive got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin option—failures not
Mom I love you but this trailers got
To go I cannot grow old in Salems Lot
So here I go its my shot feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go 
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go 
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better…
You can do anything you set your mind to manWoah Joyner Joyner yeah yeah yeah
Yeah I done did a lot of things in my day I admit it
I dont take back what I say if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy but Ill prolly never get it
I aint never had no trophy or no motherfuckin ribbon 
Fuck the system Im that nigga bend the law cut the rules
Im about to risk it all I aint got too much to lose
Yall been eatin long enough its my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate Where my drink This my day lucky you
Fuck you too woo
Yall gotta move yall gotta move yall gotta move
Give me some room give me some room give me the juice
Hop out the coupe hop out the coupe hop out and shoot
Yall gotta move yall gotta move give me the juice
Back on my bullshit my back to the wall
Turn my back on you all of you finished
Back to these bullets its back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin
Back on my hood shit its back to the pushin
These packs and Im actually pumpin
Cant fuck with you rappers you practically suckin
You mighta went platinum but that dont mean nothin
Im actually buzzin this time
Straight out the kitchen I told em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys
If I dont kill you just know you gon suffer this time
I aint no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies a partridge a pear tree
My 12 days of Christmas was nothin but lies 
Run at you hard like a sumo 
They say I talk like a chulo 
I live in Mars Im not Bruno 
Bitch Im a dog call me Cujo 
You play your cards I reverse on you all
And I might just draw 4 like a Uno 
Cállate boca mejor maricón little puto and all of you culo 
Theyve invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin for somethin I prolly can never find now
Shit get relevant til nother beef die down
In truth a nigga just really want me tied down
Ive been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty Ill tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my sonll be alright now
I said aint no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke 
When I die Im goin out as the underdog who never lost hope 
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga wrong way wrong road 
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin lawn mower 
I done said a lotta things in my day I admit it
This is payback in a way I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys but I sold my soul to get em
Wasnt in it for the trophies just the fuckin recognition
Fucks the difference
Im that cracker bend the law fuck the rules
Man I used to risk it all now I got too much to lose
Ive been eatin long enough man my stomach should be full
I just ate licked the plate my buffet lucky me
Fuck you think 
I got a couple of mansions
Still I dont have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it dont actually matter
Theyre askin me What the fuck happened to hiphop
I said I dont have any answers
Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but Im back on these rappers
And actually comin from humble beginnings
Im somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say What a wonderful feeling
Were on the upswing like were punchin the ceiling
But nothin is feeling like anyone has any fuckin ability
To even stick to a subject its killin me
The inability to pen humility
Hatata batata why dont we make a bunch of
Fuckin songs about nothin and mumble em
Fuck it Im goin for the jugular
Shit is a circus you clowns that are comin up
Dont give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Lets recap way back MCs that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADATs where the G Raps and Kanes at
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin face tats syruped out like tree sap
I dont hate trap and I dont wanna seem mad
But in fact where the old me at The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back I need that
But I think its inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though 
And if I pay it attention Im probly makin it bigger
But youve been takin ya digs in the fuckin back ho 
On the brink any minute got me thinkin of finishin
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin the benefits
Im asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin about an evil intent
Of another beat Ima kill again
Cause even if I gotta end up eatin a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well cause Ima end up bein a villain again
Levels to this shit I got an elevator
You could never say to me Im not a fuckin record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made I never cater
Motherfucker now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote til the wheels fall off Im workin tirelessly ayy
Its the moment yall been waitin for
Like California wishin rain to pour
In that drought yall been prayin for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall that outlaw
That they say as a writer mightve fell off
Im back on that bull like the cowboy
So yall gotta move  yall gotta move  yall gotta move
Give me some room give me some room give me the juice
Hop out the coupe hop out the coupe hop out and shoot
Yall gotta move yall gotta move give me the juiceLook I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
But Im only going to get this one chance 
Somethings wrong I can feel it 
Just a feeling Ive got Like somethings about to happen but I dont know what 
If that means what I think it means were in trouble big trouble 
And if he is as bananas as you say Im not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered
Im beginnin to feel like a Rap God Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box
They said I rap like a robot so call me Rapbot
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My penll go off when I halfcock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin and a killin off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin on his nutsack
Im an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables skillaholic 
This flippity dippityhippity hiphop
You dont really wanna get into a pissin match
With this rappity brat packin a MAC in the back of the Ac
Backpack rap crap yapyap yacketyyack
And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while Im practicin that
Ill still be able to break a motherfuckin table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow All I do is drop Fbombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin a rough time period heres a maxi pad
Its actually disastrously bad for the wack
While Im masterfully constructing this masterpiece as
Cause Im beginnin to feel like a Rap God Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box
Let me show you maintainin this shit aint that hard that hard
Everybody wants the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got
Well to be truthful the blueprints
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since 
MCs get taken to school with this music
Cause I use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me Im a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz 2Pac NWA Cube hey Doc Ren
Yella Eazy thank you they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–DMC induct them
Into the motherfuckin Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though Ill walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame Ill be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think its all a game til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin
Little gaylookin boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face lookin boy 
Youre witnessin a massoccur
Like youre watching a church gathering take place lookin boy
Oy vey that boys gay—thats all they say lookin boy
You get a thumbs up pat on the back
And a way to go from your label every day lookin boy
Hey lookin boy What you say lookin boy
I get a hell yeah from Dre lookin boy
Ima work for everything I have never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face lookin boy
Basically boy youre never gonna be capable
Of keepin up with the same pace lookin boy cause—
Im beginnin to feel like a Rap God Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod back nod
The way Im racin around the track call me NASCAR NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planets Krypton—no Asgard Asgard
So youll be Thor Ill be Odin
You rodent Im omnipotent
Let off then Im reloadin
Immediately with these bombs Im totin
And I should not be woken
Im the walkin dead but Im just a talkin head a zombie floatin
But I got your mom deepthroatin
Im out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin in common poodle
Im a Doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil
Its me my honestys brutal
But its honestly futile if I dont utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin at me like its lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like Im on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin
To censor you like that one line
I said on Im Back from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say Ill take seven kids from Columbine
Put em all in a line add an AK47 a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I aint as big as I was but Im
Morphin into an immortal comin through the portal
Youre stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I dont know what the fuck that you rhyme for
Youre pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin cornrows
You write normal Fuck being normal
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweathers pad
Singin to a man while he played piano
Man oh man that was a 247 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day Hey Fab Ima kill you
Lyrics comin at you at supersonic speed 
Uh summalumma doomalumma you assumin Im a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you Im superhuman
Innovative and Im made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin off of me and itll glue to you and
Im devastating more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin audience a feeling like its levitating
Never fading and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off theyll be celebrating
Cause I know the way to get em motivated
I make elevating music you make elevator music
Oh hes too mainstream
Well thats what they do when they get jealous they confuse it
Its not hiphop its pop—cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make em lose it
I dont know how to make songs like that
I dont know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While Im rippin any one of these verses that versus you
Its curtains Im inadvertently hurtin you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too
Ugh school flunky pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself but still hungry
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And Im a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues but its still tongueincheek fuck you
Im drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel
Ima sleep in the front seat
Bumpin Heavy D and the Boyz still Chunky but Funky
But in my head theres something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and heres what they want from me
Theyre askin me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it lifes handin you lemons Make lemonade then
But if I cant batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then
Dont mistake him for Satan its a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad and make her fall on her face and
Dont be a retard—be a king Think not
Why be a king when you can be a GodIve been a liar been a thief
Been a lover been a cheat
All my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
Well little one I dont want to admit to something
If all its gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
Hes comin home with his neck scratched to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks mismatched
On his breaths Jack hes a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
Its a chess match shes on his back like a jetpack
Shes kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin on to the next
Actually just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
Cause she loves danger psychopath
And you dont fuck with no mans girl even I know that
But shes devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand says their relationships hangin by a strand
So shes been on the web lately
Says maybe shell be my Gwen Stacy to spite her man
And I know shes using me to try to play him I dont care
Hi Suzanne but I shoulda said Bye Suzanne
After the first night but tonight I am
Ive been a liar been a thief
Been a lover been a cheat
All my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
Well little one I dont want to admit to something
If all its gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
A onenight stand turned a twonight stand
It was come sunlight scram now we hug tight and
He found out now she feels deserted and used
Cause he left so what He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that were through
Its hard to find the words Im aloof nervous and Sue
Dont want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth
Dont take it personal I just cant say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio like holeinthewall diners
Dont have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who Im turning intos
Irreversible I preyed on you like its church at the pew
And now that I got you I dont want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do
Get on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin the wound
Cause now with her in the womb
We cant bring her in this world shoulda knew
To use protection fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck
Ive been a liar been a thief
Been a lover been a cheat
All my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
Well little one I dont want to admit to something
If all its gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
My names  my names 
River  river run
Call me  call me 
River  well let the river run
Always the bridesmaid never The bride hey
Fuck can I say If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave Id be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate like Im slidin on ice maybe
Thats why I may have came at you sideways
I cant keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck tangled
What else can I say It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didnt really wanna abort but fuck it
Whats one more lie to tell our unborn child
Ive been a liar been a thief
Been a lover been a cheat
All my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
Well little one 
I dont want to admit to something 
If all its gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river runIm friends with the monster thats under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
Youre tryin to save me stop holdin your breath
And you think Im crazy yeah you think Im crazy
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well guess beggars cant be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
For wantin my cake and eat it too and wantin it both ways
Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated
When I blew see but it was confusing
‘Cause all I wanted to dos be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo Hit the lottery oohwee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin a used mink
Ironic ‘cause I think Im gettin so huge I need a shrink
Im beginnin to lose sleep one sheep two sheep
Goin coocoo and kooky as Kool Keith
But Im actually weirder than you think ‘cause Im—

Im friends with the monster thats under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
Youre tryin to save me stop holdin your breath
And you think Im crazy yeah you think Im crazy
Well thats nothin 
Well thats nothin 
Now I aint much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And dont squander it ‘cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow so I keep conjurin
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah ponderinll do you wonders
No wonder youre losin your mind the way it wanders
Yodelodelayheehoo I think it went wanderin off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
‘Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
‘Cause the very thing that I loves killin me and I cant conquer it
My OCDs conkin me in the head keep knockin
Nobodys home Im sleepwalkin
Im just relayin what the voice in my heads sayin
Dont shoot the messenger Im just friends with the—

Im friends with the monster thats under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
Youre tryin to save me stop holdin your breath
And you think Im crazy yeah you think Im crazy
Well thats nothin 
Well thats nothin 
Call me crazy but I have this vision one day that
Ill walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed and
Im comin straight at MCs blood gets spilled and
Ill take you back to the days that Id get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumpedup feelin
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I aint here to save the fuckin children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin through a struggle feels it and relates thats great
Its payback Russell Wilson fallin way back
In the draft turn nothin into somethin still can make that
Straw into gold chump I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts I am nuts for real but Im okay with that
Its nothin Im still friends with the—
Im friends with the monster thats under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
Youre tryin to save me stop holdin your breath
And you think Im crazy yeah you think Im crazy

Im friends with the monster thats under my bed
 Get along with the voices inside of my head
 Youre tryin to save me stop holdin your breath
 And you think Im crazy yeah you think Im crazy
Well thats nothin

Well thats nothin Plane crash
Yeah 
Yo Im just gonna write down my first thoughts and see where this takes me ’cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin face right now
Yeah
Let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate Im ’bout to break it down
Aint no mistakes allowed but make no mistake Im bout
To rape the alphabet I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out 
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but aint thinkin bout no bank account
But bitch Im off the chain like Kala Brown
Motherfucker shut the fuck up when I’m talkin’ lil bitch
I’m sorry wait whats your talent Oh critiquin
My talent Oh bitch I dont know who the fuck y’all are
To give a subpar bar or even have an opinion or view
You mention me millions of views attention in news
I mention you loselose for me winwin for you
Billions of views your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks but bitch you just lit the fuse
Dont get misconstrued business as us
Shitlist renewed so get shit to do
Or get dissed cause I just dont get
What the fuck half the shit is that youre listenin to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though Probly no
Get this fuckin audio out my Audi yo adiós
I can see why people like Lil Yachty but not me though
Not even dissin it just aint for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe Stan just isnt your cup of tea 
Maybe your cups full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit preferably
Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill yall want me to ill
I should eat a pill probably I will
Old me killed the new me watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror I dont see my breath
Possibly Im dead I must be possessed
Like an evil spell Im EVIL 
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
With an ice pick stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that Id rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ man how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch 
You wont ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the MIC
I polarize shit so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch I got the club on smash like a nightstick 
Turn down for what
I aint loud enough nah turn the Valium up 
Cause I dont know how Im gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesnt matter what caliber
I spit at Ill bet a hundred thousand bucks
Youll turn around and just be like Man how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just cause his album sucks
And now he wants to take it out on us 
But last week an exfan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
Itll help me get back to myself and shell love me 
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
Id just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me 
So fingerbang chicken wang MGK Igg Azae
Lil Pump Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game pick a name
Im fed up with bein humble
And rumor is Im hungry Im sure you heard rumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin but its jumbled in mumbojumbo
The era that Im from will pummel you thats what its comin to
What the fuck youre gonna do when you run into it
Im gonna crumble you and Ill take a number two
And dump on you if you aint Joyner
If you aint Kendrick or Cole or Sean then youre a goner
Im bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonalds
But if youre lookin to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But yall are actin like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals shoulda been autotuned
And you woulda bought it
But sayin I no longer got it
Cause you missed a line and never caught it
Cause it went over your head because youre too stupid to get it
Cause youre mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge but youll never be an artist
And Im harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What Ill never be is flawless all Ill ever be is honest 
Even when Im gone theyre gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldnt bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that Ima hit my bottom
If I dont pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I dont see why yall even started with me
I get in beefs my enemies die
I dont cease fire til at least all are deceased
Im east side never be caught slippin
Now you see why I dont sleep not even a wink I dont blink
I dont doze off I dont even nod to the beats
I dont even close my fuckin eyes when I sneeze
Aw man That BET cypher was weak it was garbage
The Thing aint even orange—oh my God thats a reach
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of yall if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine or you think water is pink
Dawg thats a date — Looks like an olive to me
Look theres an apple — No its not its a peach
So fingerbang Pootie Tang
Burger King Gucci Gang dookie dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway doesnt matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But Im gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse bitch 
Invite em in like a One A Day
Im not done 
Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand was it even worth it
Cause the way I see people turnings
Makin it seem worthless its startin to defeat the purpose
Im watchin my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin to do the right thing but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined
Cause Im determined to be me critiqued or worshipped
But if I could go back Id at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that hes deserted
But I think its workin
These verses are makin him a wee bit nervous
And hes too scurred to answer me with words
Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least hes heard it
Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin him
Or ask if Im linked to terrorists
I said Only when it comes to ink and lyricists
But my beef is more media journalists
I said my beef is more meaty a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes I mean eating a penis
Cause theyve been pannin my album to death
So Ive been givin the media fingers
Dont wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
But theyve been puttin me through the ringer
So I aint ironin shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleanersI got a song filled with shit for the strongwilled
When the world gives you a raw deal
Sets you off til you scream Piss off Screw you
When it talks to you like you dont belong
Or tells you youre in the wrong field
When somethings in your mitochondrial
Cause it latched on to you like—
Knock knock let the devil in
Manevolent as Ive ever been head is spinnin
This medicines screamin LLLLet us in
LLLLike a salad bowl Edgar Allan Poe
Bedridden shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol gelatins think my skeletons meltin
Wicked I get all high when I think Ive smelled the scent
Of elephant manure—hell I meant Kahlúa
Screw it to hell with it I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up mymymyself again
Volkswagen tailspin bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmanns and being rail thin
FiletoFish Scribble Jam Rap Olympics 97 Freaknik
How can I be down Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proofs room slept on the floor of da motel then
Dr Dre said Hell yeah
And I got his stamp like a postcard word to MelMan
And I know theyre gonna hate
But I dont care I barely can wait
To hit em with the snare and the bass
Square in the face this fuckin world better prepare to get laced
Because theyre gonna taste my—
Venom  adrenaline momentum
And Im not knowin when Im

Ready to snap any moment Im

Shotgun pppellets in the felt pen
Cocked fuck around and catch a hot one
Itits evident Im not done
VVenomous the thoughts spun
Like a web and you just caught in em
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this aint gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills fuck up the track
Like whats her names at the wheel Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy a nut crashin
Into ya the back of it just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed much as my rear fender assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi 
Translation I will probably kill us both
When I end up backin into ya
You aint gonna be able to tell what the fucks happenin to ya
When youre bit with the—
Venom adrenaline momentum
And Im not knowin when Im
Ever gonna slow up and Im
Ready to snap any moment Im
Thinkin its time to go get em
They aint gonna know what hit em
Venom  adrenaline momentum
And Im not knowin when Im
Ever gonna slow up and Im
Ready to snap any moment Im
Thinkin its time to go get em
They aint gonna know what hit em
I said knock knock let the devil in
Alien EEElliott phone home

On this game will end Im loco
Became a Symbiote so
My fangs are in your throat ho
Youre snakebitten with my—venom
With the ballpoint pen Im
Gun cocked bump stock doubleaught buckshot
Tire thumper a garrote tie a couple knots
Fired up and caught fire juggernaut
Punk rock bitch its goin down like Yung Joc
Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not you only get one shot
Ate shit til I cant taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner then drank til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons Im bonded to
Cause theyre chasin me but Im part of you
So escapin me is impossible
I latch onto you like a—parasite
And I probably ruined your parents life
And your childhood too
Cause if Im the music that yall grew up on
Im responsible for you retarded fools
Im the super villain Dad and Mom was losin their marbles to
You marvel that Eddie Brock is you
And Im the suit so call me—
Venom  adrenaline momentum
And Im not knowin when Im
Ever gonna slow up and Im
Ready to snap any moment Im
Thinkin its time to go get em
They aint gonna know what hit em
Venom  adrenaline momentum
And Im not knowin when Im
Ever gonna slow up and Im
Ready to snap any moment Im
Thinkin its time to go get em
They aint gonna know what hit em
