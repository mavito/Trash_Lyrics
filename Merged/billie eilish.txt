I should have known
Id leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
We were a pair
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life but life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love you
Was I reckless to help
Was it obvious to everybody else
That Id fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once fool me twice
Are you death or paradise
Now youll never see me cry
Theres just no time to die
I let it burn
Youre no longer my concern mmm
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn
That Id fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once fool me twice
Are you death or paradise
Now youll never see me cry
Theres just no time to die
No time to die mmm
No time to die ooh
Fool me once fool me twice
Are you death or paradise
Now youll never see me cry
Theres just no time to dieWhite shirt now red my bloody nose
Sleepin youre on your tippy toes
Creepin around like no one knows
Think youre so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Dont say thank you or please
I do what I want when Im wanting to
My soul So cynical
So youre a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just cant get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
Im that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
Im the bad guy
Duh
Im the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you dont
Own me Ill let you play the role
Ill be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she wont sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
Shell pity the men I know
So youre a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just cant get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
Im that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
Im the bad guy
Duh
Im the bad guy duh
Im only good at bein bad bad
I like when you get mad
I guess Im pretty glad that youre alone
You said shes scared of me
I mean I dont see what she sees
But maybe its cause Im wearing your cologne
Im a bad guy
Im Im a bad guy
Bad guy bad guy
Im a badBillie
What do you want from me Why dont you run from me
What are you wondering What do you know
Why arent you scared of me Why do you care for me
When we all fall asleep where do we go
Come here
Say it spit it out what is it exactly
Youre payin Is the amount cleanin you out Am I satisfactory
Today Im thinkin about the things that are deadly
The way Im drinkin you down
Like I wanna drown like I wanna end me
Step on the glass staple your tongue 
Bury a friend try to wake up 
Cannibal class killing the son 
Bury a friend I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna I wanna I wanna… end me
I wanna I wanna I wanna…
What do you want from me Why dont you run from me
What are you wondering What do you know
Why arent you scared of me Why do you care for me
When we all fall asleep where do we go
Listen
Keep you in the dark what had you expected
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected
Ill meet you in the park Ill be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that youd fall apart
Cause Im too expensive
Its probably somethin that shouldnt be said out loud
Honestly I thought that I would be dead by now 
Calling security keepin my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now
The debt I owe gotta sell my soul
Cause I cant say no no I cant say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes wont close
And I cant say no I cant say no
Careful
Step on the glass staple your tongue 
Bury a friend try to wake up 
Cannibal class killing the son 
Bury a friend I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna I wanna I wanna… end me
I wanna I wanna I wanna…
What do you want from me Why dont you run from me
What are you wondering What do you know
Why arent you scared of me Why do you care for me
When we all fall asleep where do we goI had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what youd think
And if Im bein honest
It mightve been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly 
So I stepped off the Golden mm
Nobody cried 
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care 
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up I see
You with me
And you say As long as Im here no one can hurt you
Dont wanna lie here but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldnt wonder why you hear
They dont deserve you
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like Im not just somebodys daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I dont wanna let anybody know
Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I dont wanna let em down
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up I see
You with me
And you say As long as Im here no one can hurt you
Dont wanna lie here but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldnt wonder why you hear
They dont deserve you
If I knew it all then would I do it again
Would I do it again
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead
If I knew it all then would I do it again
Would I do it again
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say insteadIts not true
Tell me I’ve been lied to
Crying isnt like you ooh
What the hell did I do
Never been the type to
Let someone see right through ooh
Maybe wont you take it back
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn’t mean to say I love you
I love you and I dont want to ooh
Up all night on another redeye
I wish we never learned to fly
Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
Didnt mean to make you cry
Maybe wont you take it back
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didnt mean to say I love you
I love you and I dont want to ooh
The smile that you gave me
Even when you felt like dying
We fall apart as it gets dark
Im in your arms in Central Park
Theres nothing you could do or say
I can’t escape the way I love you
I don’t want to but I love you ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh oohDont be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show never tell
But I know you too well
Got a mood that you wish you could sell
If teardrops could be bottled
Thered be swimming pools filled by models
Told a tight dress is what makes you a whore
If I love you was a promise
Would you break it if youre honest
Tell the mirror what you know shes heard before
I dont wanna be you
Anymore
Hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold
Hurt I cant shake
Weve made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break
If teardrops could be bottled
Thered be swimming pools filled by models
Told a tight dress is what makes you a whore
If I love you was a promise
Would you break it if youre honest
Tell the mirror what you know shes heard before
II dont wanna be you
I dont wanna be you
I dont wanna be you
AnymoreThought I found a way
Thought I found a way out 
But you never go away 
So I guess I gotta stay now
Oh I hope some day Ill make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide but I cant find one near
Wanna feel alive outside I cant fight my fear
Isnt it lovely all alone
Heart made of glass my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces skin to bone
Hello welcome home
Walking out of time
Looking for a better place 
Somethings on my mind
Always in my head space
But I know someday Ill make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide but I cant find one near
Wanna feel alive outside I cant fight my fear
Isnt it lovely all alone
Heart made of glass my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces skin to bone
Hello welcome home
Woah yeah
Yeah ah
Woah woah
Hello welcome homeDont you know Im no good for you
Ive learned to lose you cant afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin
But nothin ever stops you leavin
Quiet when Im coming home and Im on my own
I could lie say I like it like that like it like that
I could lie say I like it like that like it like that
Dont you know too much already
Ill only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend but keep me closer 
And Ill call you when the partys over
Quiet when Im coming home and Im on my own
And I could lie say I like it like that like it like that
Yeah I could lie say I like it like that like it like that
But nothin is better sometimes
Once weve both said our goodbyes
Lets just let it go
Let me let you go
Quiet when Im coming home and Im on my own
I could lie say I like it like that like it like that
I could lie say I like it like that like it like thatBaby I dont feel so good six words you never understood
Ill never let you go five words youll never say 
I laugh along like nothings wrong four days has never felt so long
If threes a crowd and two was us one slipped away 
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way
I cant tell you how much I wish I didnt wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
Is there a reason were not through
Is there a 12 step just for you
Our conversations all in blue
11 heys 
Ten fingers tearin out my hair
Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at 7 you were six minutes away
How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way
I cant tell you how much I wish I didnt wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest an explanation
Dont say Im not your type
Just say that Im not your preferred sexual orientation
Im so selfish
But you make me feel helpless yeah
And I cant stand another day
Stand another day
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way hmm
I cant tell you how much I wish I didnt wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gayIve been watchin you for some time
Cant stop starin at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
Im scared
Ive never fallen from quite this high
Fallin into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Ive been walkin through a world gone blind
Cant stop thinkin of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes
No fair 
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes 
Im scared 
Ive never fallen from quite this high
Fallin into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Dadadadada dadadadada 
 Dadadadadada
Dadada 
Mmm 
Mmm 
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
Im scared
Ive never fallen from quite this high
Fallin into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
